# Digital Advertising Cost-Volume Optimization System

A simple Python application designed to analyze and predict the cost-volume relationship of digital advertising based on the input CSV data & Machine Learning, aiming to optimize budget allocation and enhance ROAS. This project is built following the guidelines provided in the Software Development Assignment and integrates multiple tools and techniques learned throughout the course.

## Feature

- #### CSV Upload and Reading: 
Enter the path to your CSV file to load data.

- #### Cost-Volume exploration& visualization : 
Visualize relationships between ROI, costs, and Buy.

- #### Cost-Volume Optimization Model(MAB): 
We can use Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) strategies for advertising budget allocation by analyzing past performance reports, thereby achieving maximization of ROI or BUY.

- #### hypothesis testing: 
Hypothesis testing can be used to determine whether the effectiveness of digital advertising has grown due to the implementation of machine learning.
## Prerequisites
